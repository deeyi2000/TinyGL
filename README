PicoGL is based on TinyGL 0.4.1 with the changes:
  . Introduce new graphic backends.
  . Use autotool to manage the configuration
  . Fixed-pointing math support

For information about TinyGL, see the file README.TinyGL

Currently, PicoGL supports the following backends:
  . X11
  . Nano-X
  . SDL
  . vesafb

The configuration of PicoGL could be done by passing the options to
./configure script:

  . --with-backend=GFX
    Select which backend you would like to use, here GFX must be x11, 
    nano-x, or sdl.

  . --enable-fixed-point
    Enable fixed-pointing support of PicoGL. It's useful with non-x86
    machines.
